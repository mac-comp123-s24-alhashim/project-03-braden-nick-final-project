## TIC TAC TOE


### Braden LaChapalle and Nick Strezo 

03-Braden-Nick-Final Project

We are looking to create a python function that creates an interactive tic tac toe game. 

We chose this project because we thought it would be a fun way to incorporate our function and GUI skills into practice. 

We were inspired by the "rock paper scissors" capstone project and we wanted to create a similair project

Define the Game Board, Display Game Board using turtle, Allow players to input their move, Check for win or draw, allow alternation between two players, loop the game so it is continuous
